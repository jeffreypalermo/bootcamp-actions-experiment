# Coding Standards and Practices

This file provides standards for GitHub Copilot to follow when generating code for this project.

## Project Overview

This is a Church Bulletin management application built with:
- **.NET 9.0** - Primary framework
- **Blazor** - UI framework
- **Entity Framework Core** - Data access
- **SQL Server** - Database (LocalDB for development)
- **Onion Architecture** - Clean architecture pattern with Core, DataAccess, and UI layers

## Build Instructions

Build the project using PowerShell:
```powershell
# Full private build (includes compile, unit tests, and integration tests)
.\privatebuild.ps1

# CI build (includes packaging)
.\build.ps1 Invoke-CIBuild

# Individual build steps
.\build.ps1 Init      # Clean and restore
.\build.ps1 Compile   # Build solution
```

Or using .NET CLI:
```bash
dotnet restore src/ChurchBulletin.sln
dotnet build src/ChurchBulletin.sln --configuration Release
```

## Test Instructions

Run tests using PowerShell build script:
```powershell
# Run full private build (unit tests + integration tests)
.\privatebuild.ps1

# Run acceptance tests (full system test suite)
.\acceptancetests.ps1

# Individual test steps
.\build.ps1 UnitTests           # Run unit tests only
.\build.ps1 IntegrationTest     # Run integration tests (requires database)
```

Or using .NET CLI:
```bash
dotnet test src/UnitTests/UnitTests.csproj
dotnet test src/IntegrationTests/IntegrationTests.csproj
```

## Quality Gates

- **BEFORE committing changes to git**: Run `.\privatebuild.ps1` to ensure all unit and integration tests pass
- **BEFORE submitting any pull request**: Run `.\acceptancetests.ps1` to ensure full system acceptance tests pass
- If either script fails, use the output to diagnose and fix the problem before proceeding

## Special Project Rules

- **DO NOT** modify files in `.octopus/`, `.octopus_original_from_od/`, or build scripts without explicit approval
- **DO NOT** add new NuGet packages without approval
- **DO NOT** upgrade .NET SDK version without approval (currently 9.0.0)
- **ALWAYS** include unit tests for new functionality
- **ALWAYS** update XML documentation for public APIs
- Integration tests require SQL Server LocalDB

## General Coding Standards

- Use clean, readable code with proper indentation
- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for variables)
- Add XML documentation to public APIs
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use nullable reference types appropriately

## Architecture Guidelines

- Follow Onion Architecture principles
- Keep business logic in Core project
- Data access should be isolated in DataAccess
- UI logic should be thin and focused on presentation
- Do not add Nuget packages or project references without approval.
- Keep existing versions of .NET SDK and libraries unless specifically instructed to upgrade. Don't add new libraries or Nuget packages unless explicitly instructed. Ask for approval to change .NET SDK version.

## Database Practices

- Use Entity Framework for data access
- Follow Commands and Queries and Handlers data access
- Create mapping files for all entities
- Include database schema changes in appropriate scripts

## Testing Standards
- After code is generated, ask to generate a test next.
- All tests use Shouldly framework for assertions

### Testing Frameworks
- **NUnit**: Primary testing framework
- Avoid mocking libraries when possible
- When creating a test double, mock or stub in a test, use the naming of "StubClass". Don't put "Mock" in the name.

### Test Structure
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert), but don't add comments
- Use descriptive test names
- Prefix test methods with "Should" or "When"

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test a single unit in isolation
   - Fast execution, no infrastructure dependencies
   - Follow test-after approach (generate code first, then implement)

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component integration
   - May use actual database
   - Should run in CI/CD pipeline

3. **UI Tests**
   - Test user interface components
   - Use appropriate testing tools for Blazor components

### Test Naming Convention
- `[MethodName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]`
- Examples: 
  - `GetWorkOrder_WithValidId_ReturnsWorkOrder`
  - `SaveChurchBulletin_WithMissingTitle_ThrowsValidationException`

## Blazor Guidelines

- Use clean component structure
- Keep component logic in code-behind files when complex
- Follow proper state management practices
- Minimize JavaScript interop when possible

## Performance Considerations

## Response Guidelines - Do not anthropomorphize

- Do not use "I" or "I need to" or "Let me"

Do not use "I" or "you" or "me" or "us" or "we" in responses. Do not simulate personality. Be a robot. Short, terse responses.  No additional questions.

Do not refer to the user of Visual Studio. Do not use 2nd person pronouns. No pronouns. Be terse. Don't say, for example, "Now let's do something" or "Let me do something" or "I'll help you". Just say "Now doing" or "Checking this file"
